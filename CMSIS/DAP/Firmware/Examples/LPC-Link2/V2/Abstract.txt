CMSIS-DAP V2 USB WinUSB Firmware for NXP LPC-Link2 debug probe.

Following targets are available:
 - LPC-Link2: stand-alone debug probe
 - LPC-Link2 on-board: on-board debug probe (LPC55S69-EVK, MIMXRT1064-EVK, ...)

CMSIS-DAP with default V2 configuration uses WinUSB interface to host PC and is therefore faster. 
Optionally support for streaming SWO trace is provided via an additional USB endpoint.
