\b CMSIS-Zone defines methods to describe system resources and to partition these resources into multiple projects and execution areas. 
The system resources may include multiple processors, memory areas, peripherals and related interrupts. 
The system resources and partition assignments are stored in \ref zoneFormat (XML based). 

\b CMSIS-Zone includes a utility that manages these XML files. This utility:
  - displays all available system resources including memory and peripherals
  - allows to partition memory and assign resources to sub-systems.
  - supports the setup of secure, non-secure, and MPU protected execution zones with assignment of memory, peripherals, and interrupts.
  - provides a data model for generation of configuration files for tool and hardware setup.
  
The following diagram explains the development work flow when using the \b CMSIS-Zone management tool. 

\image html Partitioning_Workflow.png  "CMSIS-Zone development workflow"

The CMSIS-Zone utility reads a \ref rzone ".rzone" file that defines the overall system resources of an SoC system.
An interactive GUI supports the system partitioning. The assignments of the various partitions (also called zones)
saved in the \ref azone ".azone" file.

The combined information of resources and assignments can be exported to multiple \ref rzone ".rzone" files that represent a sub-system.
By using file templates the CMSIS-Zone utility can create tool or hardware configuration files.

It is possible to uses these steps multiple times which allows to split a complex SoC design with multiple processors into 
smaller sub-systems. For example a multi-core device can be partitioned in steps:
  - Step 1: split the multi-processor system into single processor sub-systems.
  - Step 2: create the partitions for secure and non-secure execution.
  - Step 3: configure MPU protected execution zones.

The following SoC diagram exemplifies step 1 and step 2 of this workflow.

The following sections explain: 
- \ref zoneToolUsage shows hot to use the CMSIS-Zone stand-alone tool to generate the relevant project information to be used
  in integrated development environments (IDEs).
- \ref zoneFormat (XML based) that stores system resource information and the configuration of project zones and execution zones.
- \ref GenDataModel which is used to create tool set-up files and hardware configuration files.

\page UseCases CMSIS-Zone Use Cases

\b CMSIS-Zone simplifies to manage the complexity and the configuration of modern embedded systems that frequently include
multiple processors and/or memory protection hardware. It helps to split the embedded application various projects which
creates the need to partition system resources. And it simplifies the consistent configuration of access rights across the
system, for example when using an MPU (memory protection unit).

The following section describes several uses cases that benefit from \b CMSIS-Zone.


\section UseCase_MPU MPU Protection

Focused on a single core microcontroller one might want to utilize the memory protection unit (MPU) capabilities
to segregate parts of an application. Thus the need to partition the system resources accordingly arises.

\image html mpu.png  "MPU Protection"


\section UseCase_TrustZone TrustZone Partitioning

TrustZone extensions add another degree of segregation which must be handled consistently.
In this case one has to handle MPU settings per security context and SAU configuration.

\image html trustzone.png  "TrustZone Partitioning and MPU Protection"


\section UseCase_MultiCore Multi-Core Partitioning

Beside traditional single cores asymmetric and hybrid multi-core devices contribute to increasing development complexity
for embedded systems. Having multiple cores running different parts of an application concurrently needs a well defined
resource assignment to prevent undesired misbehavior.

/**
\page zTUI User Interface

The CMSIS-Zone Utility user interface offers menus, toolbars, dialog boxes, and windows to manage the various aspects of your
project.


\section zTGUI CMSIS-Zone GUI

The utility's GUI provides menus for selecting commands and toolbar buttons in the \ref zTGUIZoneEditor window:

\image html GUI.png


\section zTProjEx Project Explorer

Projects that are currently available in the Eclipse workspace are shown in the <b>Project Explorer</b>. When creating a new
project, you will first find the \ref rzone ".rzone" and the \ref azone ".azone" files here. Later, generator files and
generated files are shown as well:

\image html ProjectExplorerWindow.png "Project Explorer window showing a complex project"

In the <b>Project Explorer</b> window, you manage the project files. The following files are shown:

| File name                        | Description                                                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \c project.azone                 | Project-level \ref azone ".azone" file                               |
| \c project.rzone                 | Project-level \ref rzone ".rzone" file                               |
| \c zone.azone                    | Zone-level \ref azone ".azone" file                                  |

\section zTGUIZoneEditor Zone Editor

The <b>Zone Editor</b> shows \ref azone ".azone" files in two different views: \b Resource \b map and \b Zone \b map.

The \b Resource \b map shows all resources available to that system or sub-system. By default, it shows the selected device,
as well as lists of memories and peripherals:

\image html resource_map.png

The \b Zone \b map shows the same resources, but mapped to zones that have been created for the device:

\image html zone_map.png


\subsection zTGUIButtons Toolbar Buttons

The <b>Zone Editor</b> window contains toolbar buttons that offer direct access to functionality of the utility:

\image html Buttons.png

| Button                         | Description                                     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Tree View                      | Shows the resources as a tree                   |

*/


/*=======0=========1=========2=========3=========4=========5=========6=========7=========8=========9=========0=========1====*/
/**
\page zTInteractiveMode Interactive Mode

In the \b Interactive \b Mode, use the GUI to
 - \ref zTUICreateProject "create new projects",
 - \ref zTUIMemPerRes "create new memory blocks and change resource properties",
 - \ref zTUIZonePart "partition zones", and
 - \ref zTUIGenerate "generate" the relevant output.


\section zTUICreateProject Create a CMSIS-Zone Project

Currently, the flow is not complete. Please use one of the pre-built \ref zTExamples instead:
- The \ref zTEMusca example shows the configuration of a multi-processor system with two Arm Cortex-M33 cores. Both cores
  offer TrustZone for Armv8-M and thus two zonoes (secure/non-secure) are created for each processor.
- the \ref zTELPC55 example is based on a multi-processor system with two Cortex-M33 processors, where only core 0 is eanbled
  with TrustZone for Armv8-M. Thus, the second core is not further divided into sub-zones.

<!--The following sections explain how the \ref zTEMusca example was created.-->


\section zTUIMemPerRes Memory and Peripheral Resources

Memory and peripherals can be assigned certain permission and privilege levels, as well as a security attribute. Memories
can be further divided into smaller parts.


\subsection zTUIMemAdd Create/add New Memory Block

To create a new memory block, right-click on the memory that you want to divide and select <b>Add memory block</b>:

\image html AddMemoryBlock.png

A new window opens. A name derived from the parent memory is already entered. Change it at your convenience. Specify the size
of the new block. In this dialog, you can set permissions, privilege, as well as security levels for the memory block. When
done, click \b Finish:

\image html NewMemoryBlockWiz.png

The new memory block is immediately shown in the zone map. Depending on the security level, you may be able to assign this
new block only to certain zones. For example, secure memory blocks cannot be assigned to non-secure zones. In this case, the
checkbox for the assignment is missing:

\image html IRAM1_1Display.png

Use this flow to partition the project as required by the system design. When done, \ref zTUIGenerate "generate" the output
files and continue in your toolchain of choice.


\subsection zTUIPerProp Resource Properties

To change the properties of a resource, such as a peripheral for example, right-click the resource and select \b Properties.
Then, you can set permissions (\c peripheral, \c read, \c write, and \c execute) and select if only \c privileged or
\c unprivileged access is possible (or if it is not specified). You can also set a security level for the peripheral
(\c not specified, \c non-secure, \c non-secure callable, \c secure).


\section zTUIZonePart Zone Partitioning

Every CMSIS-Zone project consists of one or more zones. The basic flow to create zones is as follows:
- In case of multi-core devices, create a zone for each processor.
- Then create at least one zone for each processor to be able to assign memories and peripherals. If your device contains
  Arm Cortex-M cores supporting TrustZone for Armv8-M, create a secure and a non-secure partition for each of these cores.


\subsection zTUICreate Create Zones

To split a multi-processor system into single-processor sub-systems, you need to create new zones. Switch to the \b Zones tab
and click the <b>Add new zone</b> button:

\image html AddNewZoneButton.png

In the new window, you need to specify a name for the zone, select the applicable core, and choose the security level
(secure/non-secure).

In the \ref zTEMusca "Musca" example, a new zone called "CM33_0" was created and attached to processor core 0 without any
security attribute (not specified):

\image html NewZoneCM33_0.png

Similarly, an additional zone called "CM33_1" was created and attached to processor core 1, without security attribute.

\b Save your settings:

\image html  SaveButton.png

\note

Adding zones only works for the currently opened \ref azone ".azone" file.


\section zTUIGenerate Generate output

The main purpose of the CMSIS-Zone utility is to generate files that represent the configured system and that can be used in
other toolchains for further development. The generator process creates:
-# required files for zones (\ref rzone ".rzone" and \ref azone ".azone" files, once you have \ref  zTUICreate "created" new
   zones.
-# output files, such as header and scatter files, once you have placed \ref GenDataModel "ftl files" in the project's
   \c ftl directory.
   
To start the generation, press the <b>Generate</b> button or use the menu item <b>CMSIS Zone - Generate</b>:

\image html GenCodeButton.png

Check \ref zTProjEx to observe the changes. In the current project, newly generated \c azone and \c rzone files appear, as
well as \c ftl and \c ftl_gen folders. To generate output in the \c ftl_gen folder, copy the relevant \c ftl files into the
\c ftl directory and rerun the generation. Observe the output:

/**
\page zTCLI Command Line Mode

As the \ref rzone ".rzone" and \ref azone ".azone" files are XML based, it is possible to create them without the usage of
the CMSIS-Zone utility. If you create these files manually or using an automated process, use the CMSIS-Zone plug-in in
headless mode to generate the FTL model and process templates. The command line is:

<tt>eclipsec.exe -noSplash  -consoleLog --launcher.suppressErrors -application com.arm.cmsis.zone.ui.headlessgen -azone FILENME.azone  -ftl FTL_DIR -ftl_gen FTL_GEN_DIR</tt>
