\mainpage System View Description

Introduction
------------
The CMSIS System View Description format(CMSIS-SVD) formalizes the description of the system
contained in ARM Cortex-M processor-based microcontrollers, in particular, the memory mapped
registers of peripherals.
The detail contained in system view descriptions is comparable to the data in device 
reference manuals. The information ranges from high level functional 
descriptions of a peripheral all the way down to the definition and purpose of an individual bit
field in a memory mapped register. 

CMSIS-SVD files are developed and maintained by silicon vendors.
Silicon vendors distribute their descriptions as part of CMSIS Device Family Packs.
Tool vendors use CMSIS-SVD files for providing device-specific debug views of peripherals in 
their debugger. Last but not least, CMSIS-compliant device header files are generated from CMSIS-SVD
files.

CMSIS-SVD Benefits
------------------
- For Software Developers:
  - Consistency between device header file and what is being displayed by the debugger.
  - Detailed information about peripherals, registers, fields, and bit values as well as named 
    interrupts from within the debugger, without the need to reference device documentation.
  - Convenient access to new and updated descriptions as part of the silicon vendor's CMSIS Device
    Family Packs as the packs are made availabl by silicon vendors.
  - Improved software development efficiency.

- For Silicon Vendors:
  - A tool vendor independent file format enables early device support by a wide range of toolchains
    with limited effort.
  - The XML-based format helps ease the integration into in-house design flows.
  - Automated generation of CMSIS compliant device header files.
  - Full control throughout the life cycle of the CMSIS-SVD files from creation to maintenance.

- For Tool Vendors:
  - Unified file format across silicon vendors helps the efficiency of supporting a wide range of 
    devices in a timely manner.
  - Silicon vendors can provide early review access to the device support via restricted access to
    CMSIS Device Family Packs.
  - Updated descriptions are available over the web simplifying the maintenance of device support.

\page svd_validate_file_pg SVD File Validation and Usage

The description quality is key to success of the CMSIS-SVD format. Aspects of
quality are:
  - Syntactical and structural compliance with the specified CMSIS-SVD format.
  - Consistency and correctness.
  - Completeness.
  - Level of detail.

<div class="title">Validation</div>
Automated validations are done on two levels:

-# <b>The CMSIS-SVD Schema File</b>: 
XML tools use the schema file for checking the syntactical and structural correctness of an XML file that
claims compliance with a certain format. The schema file <em>CMSIS-SVD.xsd</em> is located in 
the folder <b>.\\CMSIS\\Utilities</b> of the \b ARM::CMSIS Pack. 
\n\n
-# <b>SVD Conversion Utility:</b> The conversion utility \ref svd_SVDConv_pg checks the semantics and consistency of the data contained in a CMSIS-SVD file. 
\b SVDConv.exe is included in the CMSIS distribution. 

<div class="title">Usage</div>
CMSIS-SVD files can be used to generate:
 -# CMSIS-compliant device header files from a CMSIS-SVD description. Refer to the conversion tool \ref svd_SVDConv_pg for details.
  CMSIS device header files are developed and maintained by the silicon vendors. Therefore, the expectation is that this conversion is only of interest to
  these parties.
 -# Debug dialogs that communicate with a debugger. See below.
 
<b>System Views</b>
\n\n A number of tool vendors support the CMSIS-SVD format with their products.
  Refer to the tools documentation to find out how to use CMSIS-SVD descriptions with the debugger of your choice.
  Please regularly check for updates to the CMSIS Device Family Packs from the silicon vendor to
  to use the latest versions of the CMSIS-SVD files.

/**
\page svd_Format_pg SVD Description (*.svd) Format

The CMSIS-SVD format is based on XML and was influenced by IP-XACT.
Due to the much wider scope and complexity of IP-XACT, it was decided to specify a separate 
format focused and tailored towards the description of the programmer's view of a device.

<strong>CMSIS-SVD XML Hierarchy</strong>

   \image html CMSIS_SVD_Schema_Gen.png "CMSIS-SVD Hierarchy Levels"

One CMSIS-SVD file contains the description of a single device. A device consists of a processor and at least
one peripheral. Each peripheral contains at least one register. A register may consist of one or more fields.
The range of values for a field may be further described with enumerated values.

- \subpage svd_xml_conventions_gr "File Conventions:"
Outlines the main conventions for writing an SVD description file.
\n\n
- \subpage svd_Example_pg 
Provides an example outlining the SVD XML structure.
\n\n
- \subpage elem_device "Device Level:"
The top level of a System View Description is the device. On this level, information is captured that 
is specific to the device as a whole. For example, the device name, description, or version. The minimal 
addressable unit as well as the bit-width of the data bus are required by the debugger to perform the
correct target accesses. \n
Default values for register attributes like register size, reset value, and access permissions can be set for the 
whole device on this level and are implicitly inherited by the lower levels of the description. If however specified
on a lower level, the default setting from a higher level will get overruled.
\n\n
- \subpage elem_cpu "CPU Level:"
The CPU section describes the processor included in the microcontroller device.
This section is mandatory if the SVD file is used to generate the device header file.
\n\n
- \subpage elem_peripherals "Peripherals Level:"
A peripheral is a named collection of registers. A peripheral is mapped to a defined <em>base address</em> within the 
device's address space. A peripheral allocates one or more exclusive address blocks relative to its base address, 
such that all described registers fit into the allocated address blocks. Allocated addresses without an associated
register description are automatically considered reserved. The peripheral can be assigned to a group of
peripherals and may be associated with one or more interrupts.
\n\n
- \subpage elem_registers "Registers Level:"
A register is a named, programmable resource that belongs to a peripheral. Registers are mapped to a defined address in
the address space of the device. An address is specified relative to the peripheral base address. 
The description of a register documents the purpose and function of the resource. A debugger requires information
about the permitted access to a resource as well as side effects triggered by read and write accesses respectively.
\n\n
- \subpage elem_fields "Fields Level:"
Registers may be partitioned into chunks of bits of distinct functionality. A chunk
is referred to as <em>field</em>. The field names within a single register must be unique.
Only architecturally defined fields shall be described. Any bits not being explicitly described are treated as reserved.
They are not displayed in the System Viewer and are padded in the bit fields of the device header file.
The case-insensitive field named <b>&quot;reserved&quot;</b> is treated as a keyword and each field with this name
is ignored.
\n\n
- \subpage elem_enumeratedValues "Enumerated Values Level:"
An enumeration maps an unsigned integer constant to a descriptive identifier and, optionally, to a description string.
Enumerations are used in C to enhance the readability of source code. Similarly, it can be used by debuggers to
provide more instructive information to the programmer, avoiding a lookup in the device documentation.
\n\n
- \subpage elem_special "Special Elements:"
Specific elements that occur in various other elements are described in this section.
\n\n 
- <b>Vendor Extensions:</b>
The CMSIS-SVD format includes a section named \tagem{vendorExtensions} positioned after the closing tag \tagem{/peripherals}.
This allows silicon vendors and tool partners to extend the description beyond the current specification.


<b>Multiple Instantiation</b>

CMSIS-SVD supports the reuse of whole sections of the description. The attribute \em derivedFrom for
\refelem{peripheral}, \refelem{register}, and \refelem{field} specifies the source of the section to be copied from.
Individual tags can be used to redefine specific elements within a copied section. 
In case the name of the description source is not unique, the name needs to be qualified hierarchically
until the element composite name becomes unique. Hierarchies 
are separated by a dot. For example, <em>\<peripheral name\>.\<register name\>.\<field name\></em>.

<b>Array of Elements</b>

A powerfull construct in data structures of the C programming language is the array. An 
array is a series of data elements of the same type selected via an index. CMSIS-SVD supports arrays
for \refelem{peripheral}, \refelem{cluster}, and \refelem{register}.

<b>Peripheral Grouping</b>

Peripherals that provide similar functionality (Simple Timer, Complex Timer) can be grouped with the element \tagem{groupName}. 
Peripheral groups help structuring the list of peripherals in the debugger.
All peripherals associated with the same group name are collectively listed under this group 
in the order they were specified in the SVD file. 

<b>Descriptions</b>

On each level, the tag \tagem{description} provides verbose information about the respective element. 
The description field plays an important part in improving software development productivity as it gives 
instant access to information that otherwise would need to be looked up in the device documentation.
