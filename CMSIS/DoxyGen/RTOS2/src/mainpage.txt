The <b>CMSIS-RTOS v2 (CMSIS-RTOS2)</b> provides generic RTOS interfaces for Arm&reg; Cortex&reg; processor-based
devices. It provides a standardized API for software components that require RTOS functionality and gives therefore serious
benefits to the users and the software industry:
 - CMSIS-RTOS2 provides basic features that are required in many applications.
 - The unified feature set of the CMSIS-RTOS2 reduces learning efforts and simplifies sharing of software components.
 - Middleware components that use the CMSIS-RTOS2 are RTOS agnostic and are easier to adapt.
 - Standard project templates of the CMSIS-RTOS2 may be shipped with freely available CMSIS-RTOS2 implementations.

\note The CMSIS-RTOS API Version 2 defines a minimum feature set. Implementations with extended features may be provided by
      the RTOS vendors.

The CMSIS-RTOS2 manages the resources of the microcontroller system and implements the concept of parallel threads that run
concurrently.

Applications frequently require several concurrent activities. CMSIS-RTOS2 can manage multiple concurrent activities at the
time when they are needed. Each activity gets a separate thread which executes a specific task and this simplifies the
overall program structure. The CMSIS-RTOS2 system is scalable and additional threads can be added easily at a later time.
Threads have a priority allowing faster execution of time-critical parts of a user application.

The CMSIS-RTOS2 offers services needed in many real-time applications, for example, periodical activation of timer functions, 
memory management, and message exchange between threads with time limits.

The CMSIS-RTOS2 addresses the following new requirements:
 - Dynamic object creation no longer requires static memory, static memory buffers are now optional.
\if ARMv8M
 - Support for Armv8-M architecture that provides a secure and non-secure state of code execution.
\endif 
 - Provisions for message passing in multi-core systems.
 - Full support of C++ run-time environments.
 - C interface which is binary compatible across
   <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.subset.swdev.abi/index.html">ABI compatible compilers</a>.

As a consequence of these requirements the CMSIS-RTOS2 has the following fundamental modifications:
 - The functions osXxxxNew replace osXxxxCreate functions; osXxxxNew and osXxxxDelete create and destroy objects.
 - The C function \c main is no longer started as a thread (this was an optional feature in CMSIS-RTOS v1).
 - Functions that return osEvent have been replaced.

CMSIS-RTOS2 provides an translation layer to <a class="el" href="../../RTOS/html/index.html">CMSIS-RTOS v1</a>. It
is possible to intermix \ref rtos_api2 and <a class="el" href="../../RTOS/html/functionOverview.html">CMSIS-RTOS C API v1</a>
within the same application. Over time, you may migrate to the new API as explained in \ref os2Migration.

CMSIS-RTOS2 is not POSIX compliant, but has provisions to enable a C++11/C++14 interface.
