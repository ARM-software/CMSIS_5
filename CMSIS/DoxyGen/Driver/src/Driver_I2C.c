\brief    Driver API for I2C Bus Peripheral (%Driver_I2C.h)
\details

I<sup>2</sup>C (Inter-Integrated Circuit, referred to as I-squared-C, I-two-C, or IIC) is a multi-master serial single-ended bus and is mostly used 
on single boards, but can also connect to components which are linked via cable. 

Most significant features of the I<sup>2</sup>C bus include:
 - Only two bus lines are required
 - I<sup>2</sup>C is a true multi-master bus. Simple master/slave relationships exist between all components
 - A baud rate is not required; the master device determines a bus clock
 - Each connected device is addressable by a unique address
 - Providing arbitration and collision detection

For more information about I<sup>2</sup>C refer to the following web pages:
  - Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank">I<sup>2</sup>C</a>
  - <a href="http://www.i2c-bus.org" target="_blank">www.i2c-bus.org</a>.

Devices can operation in Master or Slave mode:

 - To operate in Master mode call the functions \ref ARM_I2C_MasterTransmit or \ref ARM_I2C_MasterReceive. These functions get as argument a <em>slave address</em>. 
 
 - To operate in Slave mode set the <em>slave address</em> using the function \ref ARM_I2C_Control. The functions \ref ARM_I2C_SlaveTransmit or \ref ARM_I2C_SlaveReceive are used to transfer data in Slave mode.

<b>I<sup>2</sup>C Slave Address</b>
 
Depending on the device, I<sup>2</sup>C supports 7-bit and 10-bit Slaves addresses. 
The element <em>address_10_bit</em> in \ref ARM_I2C_CAPABILITIES indicates that the driver is able to handle 10-bit addresses.
A 10-bit Slave address is ORed with \ref ARM_I2C_ADDRESS_10BIT.
 
I<sup>2</sup>C also supports a General Call to all Slaves by using the slave address value \token{0}.
A General Call is recognized by Slaves have a slave address value \ref ARM_I2C_ADDRESS_GC registered with the 
function \ref ARM_I2C_Control.

<b>Block Diagram</b>

The I2C driver allows you to connect low-speed peripherals to a motherboard, embedded system, cellphone, or other electronic device.

<b>I<sup>2</sup>C API</b>

The following header files define the Application Programming Interface (API) for the I<sup>2</sup>C interface:
  - \b %Driver_I2C.h : Driver API for I2C Bus Peripheral

The driver implementation is a typical part of the Device Family Pack (DFP) that supports the 
peripherals of the microcontroller family.


<b>Driver Functions</b>

The driver functions are published in the access struct as explained in \ref DriverFunctions
  - \ref ARM_DRIVER_I2C : access struct for I2C driver functions


\anchor example <b>Example Code</b>

The following example code shows the usage of the I<sup>2</sup>C interface in Master mode.

/**
\struct     ARM_DRIVER_I2C
\details
The functions of the I2C interface are accessed by function pointers exposed by this structure. Refer to \ref DriverFunctions for 
overview information.

Each instance of an I2C provides such an access structure. The instance is indicated by
a postfix in the symbol name of the access structure, for example:
 - \b Driver_I2C0 is the name of the access struct of the first instance (no. 0).
 - \b Driver_I2C1 is the name of the access struct of the second instance (no. 1).


A configuration setting in the middleware allows connecting the middleware to a specific driver instance <b>%Driver_I2C<i>n</i></b>.
The default is \token{0}, which connects a middleware to the first instance of a driver.

This function \b ARM_I2C_MasterTransmit transmits data as Master to the selected Slave.

The operation consists of:
 - Master generates START condition
 - Master addresses the Slave as Master Transmitter
 - Master transmits data to the addressed Slave
 - Master generates STOP condition (if \em xfer_pending is "false")

The parameter \em addr is the address of the slave to transmit the data to. The value can be ORed with \ref ARM_I2C_ADDRESS_10BIT to 
identify a 10-bit address value. \n
The parameter \em data and \em num specify the address of a data buffer and the number of bytes to transmit. \n
Set the parameter \em xfer_pending to 'true' if another transfer operation follows. With \em xfer_pending set to 'false' a STOP condition is generated.

The function is non-blocking and returns as soon as the driver has started the operation.
During the operation it is not allowed to call any Master function again. Also the data buffer must stay allocated and the contents of data must not be modified. 
When transmit operation has finished the \ref ARM_I2C_EVENT_TRANSFER_DONE event is generated.
When not all the data is transferred then the \ref ARM_I2C_EVENT_TRANSFER_INCOMPLETE flag is set at the same time.

Number of data bytes transmitted and acknowledged is returned by the function \ref ARM_I2C_GetDataCount during and after the operation has finished.

The operation is aborted in the following cases (\ref ARM_I2C_EVENT_TRANSFER_DONE event is generated together with):
 - selected slave has not acknowledged the address: \ref ARM_I2C_EVENT_ADDRESS_NACK event
 - arbitration has been lost: \ref ARM_I2C_EVENT_ARBITRATION_LOST event
 - bus error has been detected: \ref ARM_I2C_EVENT_BUS_ERROR event

Status can be monitored by calling the \ref ARM_I2C_GetStatus and checking the flags.

\ref ARM_I2C_BUS_SPEED           | Set Bus Speed; \em arg = bus speed
\ref ARM_I2C_BUS_CLEAR           | Clear the bus by sending nine clock pulses
\ref ARM_I2C_ABORT_TRANSFER      | Aborts the data transfer between Master and Slave for Transmit or Receive 

<b>Set Own Slave Address</b>

After initialization, the I2C Device has no slave address assigned and does not accept any requests from 
an I2C Master.

The \em control operation \ref ARM_I2C_OWN_ADDRESS sets the slave address with the parameter \em arg.
The slave address can be ORed with \ref ARM_I2C_ADDRESS_10BIT to indicate a 10-bit address.  

The slave address can be ORed with \ref ARM_I2C_ADDRESS_GC to indicate that the slave accepts a General Call.
If the slave address value is only \ref ARM_I2C_ADDRESS_GC, then the slave only accepts a General Call.

The slave address value \token{0} disables Slave mode and clears any assigned slave address.

**Examples:**

Set the Slave address value \token{0x45} as 7-bit address.
\code
  I2Cdrv->Control      (ARM_I2C_OWN_ADDRESS, 0x45);
\endcode

Set the Slave address value \token{0x135} as 10-bit address and accept a General Call.
\code
  I2Cdrv->Control      (ARM_I2C_OWN_ADDRESS, 0x135 | ARM_I2C_ADDRESS_10BIT | ARM_I2C_ADDRESS_GC);
\endcode

<b>Bus Speed</b>

The \em control operation \ref ARM_I2C_BUS_SPEED sets the bus speed using the parameter \em arg.

Parameter \em arg                | Bus Speed
:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------
\ref ARM_I2C_BUS_SPEED_STANDARD  | Standard Speed to (\token{100 kHz})
\ref ARM_I2C_BUS_SPEED_FAST      | Fast Speed  (\token{400kHz})
\ref ARM_I2C_BUS_SPEED_FAST_PLUS | Fast + Speed (\token{1MHz})
