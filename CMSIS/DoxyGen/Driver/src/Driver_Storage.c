\brief    Driver API for Storage Device Interface (%Driver_Storage.h)
\details
This is an abstraction for a storage controller. It offers an interface to
access an address space of storage locations, comprising APIs for
initialization, erase, access, program, and status-fetch operations. It also
offers APIs to iterate over the available Storage Blocks (\ref
ARM_STORAGE_BLOCK), allowing the discovery of block attributes such as
write/erase granularities. Using the Storage abstraction, it becomes possible to
write generic algorithms, such as block copy, to operate on any conforming
storage device.

\note The storage abstraction layer is not responsible for storage management.
Algorithms such as block-allocation, wear-leveling, erase-before-write and other
storage-management policies are the responsibility of modules external to the
storage abstraction layer. In essence, the storage interface is the lowest
abstraction upon which block management policies can be implemented.

Here's a picture to help locate the storage abstraction in the software stack.
The part below the box labeled 'Storage abstraction layer' is implemented by a
storage driver.

/**
\struct     ARM_STORAGE_INFO
\details
It describes the characteristics of a Storage device. This includes total
storage, programming size, a default value for erased memory etc. This
information can be obtained from the Storage device datasheet and is used by the
middleware in order to properly interact with the Storage device.

Total available storage (in bytes) is contained in \em total_storage. Minimum
programming size (in bytes) is described by \em program_unit (applicable only if
the \em programmable attribute is set for a block). It defines the granularity
for programming data. The offset of the start of a program-range and the size
should also be aligned with \em program_unit.
\note: setting \em program_unit to 0 has the effect of disabling the size and
alignment restrictions (setting it to 1 also has the same effect).

Optimal programming page-size (in bytes) is specified by \em
optimal_program_unit. Some storage controllers have internal buffers into which
to receive data. Writing in chunks of \em optimal_program_unit would achieve
maximum programming speed. Like with \em program_unit, this is applicable only
if the \em programmable attribute is set for the underlying storage block(s).

\em program_cycles is a measure of endurance for reprogramming.
A value of \em ARM_STORAGE_PROGRAM_CYCLES_INFINITE may be used to signify
infinite or unknown endurance.

Contents of erased memory is specified by the \em erased_value. It is usually
\token{1} to indicate erased bytes with state 0xFF.

\em memory_mapped can be set to \token{1} to indicate that the storage device
has a mapping onto the processor's memory address space.
\note: For a memory-mapped block which isn't erasable but is programmable,
writes should be possible directly to the memory-mapped storage without going
through the \ref ARM_Storage_ProgramData operation.

The field \em programmability holds a value to indicate storage programmability.
Similarly, \em retention_level holds a for encoding data-retention levels for
all storage blocks.

\note
These fields serve a different purpose than the ones contained in
\ref ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES, which is another structure containing device-level
metadata. ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES describes the API capabilities, whereas
ARM_STORAGE_INFO describes the device. Furthermore ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES fits
within a single word, and is designed to be passed around by value;
ARM_STORAGE_INFO, on the other hand, contains metadata which doesn't fit into a
single word and requires the use of pointers to be moved around.

/**
\struct ARM_DRIVER_STORAGE
\details
This is the set of operations constituting the Storage driver. Their
implementation is platform-specific, and needs to be supplied by the porting
effort. The functions of the Storage driver are accessed by function pointers
exposed by this structure. Refer to \ref StorageDriverFunctions for overview
information.

Each instance of a Storage interface provides such an access structure.
The instance is identified by a postfix number in the symbol name of the access structure, for example:
 - \b Driver_Storage0 is the name of the access struct of the first instance (no. 0).
 - \b Driver_Storage1 is the name of the access struct of the second instance (no. 1).

A middleware configuration setting allows connecting the middleware to a specific driver instance \b %Driver_Flash<i>n</i>.
The default is \token{0}, which connects a middleware to the first instance of a driver.

/**
\defgroup StorageDriverFunctions Use of Storage APIs

Function pointers within \ref ARM_DRIVER_STORAGE form the set of operations
constituting the Storage driver. Their implementation is platform-specific, and
needs to be supplied by the porting effort.

Some of these APIs will always operate synchronously:
- \ref ARM_Storage_GetVersion
- \ref ARM_Storage_GetCapabilities
- \ref ARM_Storage_GetStatus
- \ref ARM_Storage_GetInfo
- \ref ARM_Storage_ResolveAddress
- \ref ARM_Storage_GetNextBlock and
- \ref ARM_Storage_GetBlock.

This means that control returns to the caller with a relevant status code only after the completion of the operation (or
the discovery of a failure condition).

The remainder of the APIs:
- \ref ARM_Storage_Initialize
- \ref ARM_Storage_Uninitialize
- \ref ARM_Storage_PowerControl
- \ref ARM_Storage_ReadData
- \ref ARM_Storage_ProgramData
- \ref ARM_Storage_Erase and
- \ref ARM_Storage_EraseAll

can function asynchronously if the underlying controller supports it; that is if ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES::asynchronous_ops
is set. In the case of asynchronous operation, the invocation returns early (with ARM_DRIVER_OK) and results in a completion
callback later. If ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES::asynchronous_ops is not set, then all such APIs execute synchronously, and
control returns to the caller with a status code only after the completion of the operation (or the discovery of a failure
condition).

If ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES::asynchronous_ops is set, a storage driver may
still choose to execute asynchronous operations in a synchronous manner. If
so, the driver returns a positive value to indicate successful synchronous
completion (or an error code in case of failure) and no further invocation of
completion callback should be expected. The expected return value for
synchronous completion of such asynchronous operations varies depending on
the operation. For operations involving data access, it often equals the
amount of data transferred or affected. For non data-transfer operations,
such as EraseAll or Initialize, it is usually 1.

Here's a code snippet to suggest how asynchronous APIs might be used by
callers to handle both synchronous and asynchronous execution by the
underlying storage driver:
\code
    ASSERT(ARM_DRIVER_OK == 0); // this is a precondition; it doesn't need to be put in code
    
    int32_t returnValue = drv->asynchronousAPI(...);
         
    if (returnValue < ARM_DRIVER_OK) {
        // handle error.
        
    } else if (returnValue == ARM_DRIVER_OK) {
        ASSERT(drv->GetCapabilities().asynchronous_ops == 1);
        // handle early return from asynchronous execution; remainder of the work is done in the callback handler.
        
    } else {
        ASSERT(returnValue == EXPECTED_RETURN_VALUE_FOR_SYNCHRONOUS_COMPLETION);
        // handle synchronous completion.
    }
\endcode

THis example is mixing synchronous and asynchronous APIs: \ref SampleUseOfStorageDriver
*******************************************************************************************************************/

/**
\struct     ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES
\details
A Storage driver can be implemented with different capabilities. The data fields
of this struct encode the API capabilities implemented by this driver.

The element \em asynchronous_ops indicates if APIs like initialize, read, erase,
program, etc. can operate in asynchronous mode. Having this bit set to 1 means
that the driver is capable of launching asynchronous operations; command
completion for asynchronous operations is signaled by the invocation of a
completion callback. If set to 1, drivers may still complete asynchronous
operations synchronously as necessary--in which case they return a positive
error code to indicate synchronous completion.  If \em asynchronous_ops is not
set, then all such APIs execute synchronously, and control returns to the caller
with a status code only after the completion of the operation (or the discovery
of a failure condition).

The element \em erase_all specifies that the \ref ARM_Storage_EraseAll function
is supported. Typically full chip erase is much faster than erasing the whole
device using \em ARM_Storage_Erase.

The function \b ARM_Storage_GetVersion returns version information of the driver implementation in \ref ARM_DRIVER_VERSION.
 - API version is the version of the CMSIS-Driver specification used to implement this driver.
 - Driver version is source code version of the actual driver implementation.

int32_t ARM_Storage_Initialize (ARM_Storage_Callback_t callback)  {
  return 0;
}
/**
\fn int32_t ARM_Storage_Initialize (ARM_Storage_Callback_t callback)
\details
The function \b ARM_Storage_Initialize is called when the middleware component starts
operation. In addition to bringing the controller to a ready state,
Initialize() receives a callback handler to be invoked upon completion of
asynchronous operations.

ARM_Storage_Initialize() needs to be called explicitly before
powering the peripheral using ARM_Storage_PowerControl(), and before initiating other
accesses to the storage controller.

The function performs the following operations:
 - Initializes the resources needed for the Storage interface.
 - Registers the \ref ARM_Storage_Callback_t callback function.

To start working with a peripheral the functions ARM_Storage_Initialize and ARM_Storage_PowerControl() need to be called in this order:
\code
   drv->Initialize (...);              // Allocate I/O pins
   drv->PowerControl (ARM_POWER_FULL); // Power up peripheral, setup IRQ/DMA
\endcode

- ARM_Storage_Initialize() typically allocates the I/O resources (pins) for the
 peripheral. The function can be called multiple times; if the I/O resources
 are already initialized it performs no operation and just returns with
 ARM_DRIVER_OK.

- ARM_Storage_PowerControl (ARM_POWER_FULL) sets the peripheral registers including
 interrupt (NVIC) and optionally DMA. The function can be called multiple
 times; if the registers are already set it performs no operation and just
 returns with ARM_DRIVER_OK.

To stop working with a peripheral the functions ARM_Storage_PowerControl() and ARM_Storage_Uninitialize() need to be called in this order:
\code
   drv->PowerControl (ARM_POWER_OFF); // Terminate any pending transfers, reset IRQ/DMA, power off peripheral
   drv->Uninitialize (...);           // Release I/O pins
\endcode

The functions ARM_Storage_PowerControl() and ARM_Storage_Uninitialize() always execute and can be used
to put the peripheral into a Safe State, for example after any data
transmission errors. To restart the peripheral in an error condition,
you should first execute the Stop Sequence and then the Start Sequence.

\note This API may execute asynchronously if
   ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES::asynchronous_ops is set. Asynchronous
   execution is optional even if 'asynchronous_ops' is set.

The function \b ARM_Storage_PowerControl operates the power modes of the Storage interface.

To start working with a peripheral the functions Initialize and PowerControl need to be called in this order:
\code
   drv->Initialize (...);                 // Allocate I/O pins
   drv->PowerControl (ARM_POWER_FULL);    // Power up peripheral, setup IRQ/DMA

- ARM_Storage_Initialize() typically allocates the I/O resources (pins) for the
 peripheral. The function can be called multiple times; if the I/O resources
 are already initialized it performs no operation and just returns with
 ARM_DRIVER_OK.

- PowerControl (ARM_POWER_FULL) sets the peripheral registers including
 interrupt (NVIC) and optionally DMA. The function can be called multiple
 times; if the registers are already set it performs no operation and just
 returns with ARM_DRIVER_OK.

To stop working with a peripheral the functions PowerControl and Uninitialize need to be called in this order:
\code
   drv->PowerControl (ARM_POWER_OFF);     // Terminate any pending transfers, reset IRQ/DMA, power off peripheral
   drv->Uninitialize (...);               // Release I/O pins
\endcode

The functions ARM_Storage_PowerControl and ARM_Storage_Uninitialize always execute and can be used
to put the peripheral into a Safe State, for example after any data
transmission errors. To restart the peripheral in an error condition,
you should first execute the Stop Sequence and then the Start Sequence.

The parameter \em state can have the following values:
  - \ref ARM_POWER_FULL : set-up the Storage device for data transfers, enable interrupts (NVIC) and optionally DMA. Can be called multiple times.
                          If the device is already in this mode, then the function performs no operation and returns with \ref ARM_DRIVER_OK.
  - \ref ARM_POWER_LOW : may use power saving. Returns \ref ARM_DRIVER_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED when not implemented.
  - \ref ARM_POWER_OFF : terminates any pending data transfers, disables peripheral, disables related interrupts and DMA.

   execution is optional even if 'asynchronous_ops' is set.

This function erases a range of storage specified by [addr, addr +

'erase_unit'(s) of the respective owning storage block(s) (see \ref
ARM_STORAGE_BLOCK and \ref ARM_STORAGE_BLOCK_ATTRIBUTES). The range to
be erased will have its contents returned to the un-programmed state--
i.e. to \ref ARM_STORAGE_INFO::erased_value, which
is usually 1 to indicate the pattern of all ones: 0xFF.

\note This API may execute asynchronously if
   ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES::asynchronous_ops is set. Asynchronous
   execution is optional even if 'asynchronous_ops' is set.

\note Erase() may return a smaller (positive) value than the size of the
   requested range. The returned value indicates the actual number of bytes
   erased. It is the caller's responsibility to follow up with an appropriate
   request to complete the operation.

\note in the case of a failed erase (except when
   ARM_DRIVER_ERROR_PARAMETER, ARM_STORAGE_ERROR_PROTECTED, or
