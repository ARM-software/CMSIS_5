/** \mainpage Overview

CMSIS-Build is now replaced with the <a href="https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/tree/main/tools" target="_blank"><b>CMSIS-Toolbox</b></a> that is a set of tools for creating and building projects that are based on software packs. It also contains tools that help to create software packs.

\section Components_of_CMSIS_Toolbox Components of CMSIS-Toolbox
The <a href="https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/tree/main/tools" target="_blank"><b>CMSIS-Toolbox</b></a> is developed under the <a href="https://www.open-cmsis-pack.org" target="_blank">Linaro Open-CMSIS-Pack</a> project and contains these tools:

- **cpackget** download, add and remove software packs.
- **csolution** to create and manage complex applications with user source files and content from software packs
- **cbuild** controls the build process that translates a project to a executable binary image.
- **packgen** to create a software pack from a CMake based software repository.
- **packchk** to validate a software pack

The <a href="https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/tree/main/tools" target="_blank"><b>CMSIS-Toolbox</b></a> can be used as stand-alone tools with command line interface (CLI) but will be integrated into several other Arm tool solutions such as:

- <a href="https://www.arm.com/virtual-hardware" target="_blank"><b>Arm Virtual Hardware</b></a> to manage the build process in CI workflows.
- <a href="https://www.keil.arm.com" target="_blank"><b>Keil Studio</b></a> as integral part of the project management.
- <a href="https://www.keil.com/mdk5/" target="_blank"><b>Keil MDK</b></a> to provide CLI tools for project generation.

\section Development_Workflow Development Workflow

The following diagram shows the development workflow using the CMSIS-Toolbox.

A solution that manages several related projects and projects can be composed using an intuitive `*.yml` format. This solution and project files are then translated using **csolution** CLI tool to the `*.CPRJ` project file format.

The individual `*.CPRJ` project files can be imported to an IDE or by using **cbuild** translated into executable binary images.

The \ref cprjFormat_pg describes the input file format that is used by **cbuild**.
