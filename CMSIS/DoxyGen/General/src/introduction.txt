\mainpage Introduction

The <b>CMSIS</b> is a set of tools, APIs, frameworks, and work flows that help to simplify software re-use, reduce the
learning curve for microcontroller developers, speed-up project build and debug, and thus reduce the time to market for new
applications.

CMSIS started as a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-M based processors and was later
extended to support entry-level Arm Cortex-A based processors. To simplify access, CMSIS defines generic tool interfaces and
enables consistent device support by providing simple software interfaces to the processor and the peripherals.

CMSIS is defined in close cooperation with various silicon and software vendors and provides a common approach to interface
to peripherals, real-time operating systems, and middleware components. It is intended to enable the combination of software
components from multiple vendors.

CMSIS is open-source and collaboratively developed on
<a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

\section Motivation Motivation

CMSIS has been created to help the industry in standardization. It enables consistent software layers and device support
across a wide range of development tools and microcontrollers. CMSIS is not a huge software layer that introduces overhead
and does not define standard peripherals. The silicon industry can therefore support the wide variations of Arm Cortex
processor-based devices with this common standard.

\image html Overview.png "CMSIS Structure"

The benefits of the CMSIS are:

 - CMSIS reduces the learning curve, development costs, and time-to-market. Developers can write software quicker through a
   variety of easy-to-use, standardized software interfaces.
 - Consistent software interfaces improve the software portability and re-usability. Generic software libraries and
   interfaces provide consistent software framework.
 - It provides interfaces for debug connectivity, debug peripheral views, software delivery, and device support to reduce
   time-to-market for new microcontroller deployment.
 - It allows to use the compiler of your choice, as it is compiler independent and thus supported by mainstream compilers.
 - It enhances program debugging with peripheral information for debuggers and ITM channels for printf-style output.
 - CMSIS is delivered in CMSIS-Pack format which enables fast software delivery, simplifies updates, and enables consistent
   integration into development tools.
 - CMSIS-Zone will simplify system resource and partitioning as it manages the configuration of multiple processors, memory
   areas, and peripherals.
 - Continuous integration is common practice for most software developers nowadays. CMSIS-Build supports these workflows
   and makes continuous testing and validation easier.


\section CodingRules Coding Rules

The CMSIS uses the following essential coding rules and conventions:
 - Compliant with ANSI C (C99) and C++ (C++03).
 - Uses ANSI C standard data types defined in \b <stdint.h>.
 - Variables and parameters have a complete data type.
 - Expressions for \c \#define constants are enclosed in parenthesis.
 - Conforms to MISRA 2012 (but does not claim MISRA compliance). MISRA rule violations are documented.

In addition, the CMSIS recommends the following conventions for identifiers:
 - \b CAPITAL names to identify Core Registers, Peripheral Registers, and CPU Instructions.
 - \b CamelCase names to identify function names and interrupt functions.
 - \b Namespace_ prefixes avoid clashes with user identifiers and provide functional groups (i.e. for peripherals, RTOS, or DSP Library).

The CMSIS is documented within the source files with:
 \li Comments that use the C or C++ style.
 \li <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/" target="_blank">Doxygen</a> compliant <b>function comments</b> that provide:
    - brief function overview.
    - detailed description of the function.
    - detailed parameter explanation.
    - detailed information about return values.

Doxygen	comment example:
\verbatim
/**
 * @brief  Enable Interrupt in NVIC Interrupt Controller
 * @param  IRQn  interrupt number that specifies the interrupt
 * @return none.
 * Enable the specified interrupt in the NVIC Interrupt Controller.
 * Other settings of the interrupt such as priority are not affected.
 */
\endverbatim


\section Validation Validation

The various components of CMSIS are validated using mainstream compilers. To get a diverse coverage, Arm Compiler v5 (based
on EDG front-end), Arm Compiler v6 (based on LLVM front-end), and GCC are used in the various tests. For each component, the
section \b "Validation" describes the scope of the various verification steps.

CMSIS components are compatible with a range of C and C++ language standards. The CMSIS components comply with the
<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0036/d" target="_blank">Application Binary Interface (ABI) for the Arm
Architecture</a> (exception CMSIS-RTOS v1). This ensures C API interfaces that support inter-operation between various
toolchains.

As CMSIS defines API interfaces and functions that scale to a wide range of processors and devices, the scope of
the run-time test coverage is limited. However, several components are validated using dedicated test suites
(<a href="../../Driver/html/driverValidation.html">CMSIS-Driver</a>,
<a href="../../RTOS/html/rtosValidation.html">CMSIS-RTOS v1</a>, and
<a href="../../RTOS2/html/rtosValidation.html">CMSIS-RTOS v2</a>).

The CMSIS source code is checked for MISRA C:2012 conformance using PC-Lint. MISRA deviations are documented with
reasonable effort, however Arm does not claim MISRA compliance as there is today for example no guideline enforcement
plan. The CMSIS source code is not checked for MISRA C++:2008 conformance as there is a risk that it is incompatible
with C language standards, specifically warnings that may be generated by the various C compilers.
