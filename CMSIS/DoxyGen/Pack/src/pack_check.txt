\page packChk packChk

\b packChk is a utility for validation of a Software Pack. It operates on the unzipped content of the Software Pack and
is located in the directory <b>.\\CMSIS\\Utilities</b> of the <b>ARM::CMSIS</b> Pack.  
\b packChk is available for Windows and Linux operating systems.

\b packChk performs the following operations:
 - Reads the content of the specified *.pdsc file. The path to this *.pdsc file is considered as root directory of the Software Pack.
 - Verifies the existence of all files in the Software Pack that are referenced in the *.pdsc file.
 - Checks for presence and correctness of mandatory elements such as \<vendor>, \<version>, etc.
 - Optionally, reads other PDSC files to resolve dependencies on \<apis>, \<boards>, and \<conditions>.
 - Optionally, checks all System View Description files (*.SVD) referenced in the *.pdsc file using SVDConv.exe. Refer to <a href="../../SVD/html/svd_validate_file_pg.html">SVD File Validation</a> for details.
 - Optionally, verifies the element \<url>.
 - Optionally, creates the standardized name of the Software Pack file for further processing in scripts.
 - Sets the exit status reflecting the validation result to: \n
     0 : no errors detected \n
     1 : errors during validation detected


Operation
---------

\b packChk is invoked from the command line:\n
\code
 packChk <pdsc_file> <options>
\endcode

<b>Examples</b>

Run \b packChk on the package description file called <b>MyVendor.MyPack.pdsc</b>. \b packChk verifies the file against the Software Pack that is located in the same directory.
\verbatim
packChk MyVendor.MyPack.pdsc
\endverbatim

Run \b packChk on the package description file called <b>MyVendor.MyPack.pdsc</b> in the current directory and try to resolve conditions using the ARM.CMSIS.pdsc file based in another directory.
\verbatim
packChk MyVendor.MyPack.pdsc -i ..\..\PACK\ARM\CMSIS\ARM.CMSIS.pdsc
\endverbatim

Run \b packChk on the  package description file called <b>MyVendor.MVCM3.pdsc</b>, verify SVD files, verify the URL to the Pack Server, and generate a ASCII text file with the standardized name of the Software Pack.
\verbatim
packChk "MyVendor.MVCM3.pdsc" -s -u "http://www.myvendor.com/pack" -n packname.txt
\endverbatim

Run \b packChk on the  package description file called <b>MyVendor.MVCM3.pdsc</b>. Suppress validation messages M304 and M331.
\verbatim
packChk MyVendor.MVCM3.pdsc -x M304 M331           // messages as a list
packChk MyVendor.MVCM3.pdsc -x M304 -x M331        // option repeated

Validation Messages
--------------------
The messages in this category are issued by packChk during package validation. This can be for example incorrect use of the pack schema in the PDSC file, missing files, broken dependancies and others. \em ERROR messages must be resolved to ensure that the package is compliant to the CMSIS-format. \em WARNING messages should be checked and are strongly recommended to be resolved.
