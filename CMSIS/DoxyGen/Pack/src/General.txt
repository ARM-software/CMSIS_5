<b>CMSIS-Pack</b> describes a delivery mechanism for software components, device parameters, and evaluation board
support. The XML-based package description (PDSC) file describes the content of a \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack"
(file collection) that includes:
 -  Source code, header files, and software libraries
 -  Documentation and source code templates
 -  Device parameters along with startup code and programming algorithms
 -  Example projects

The complete file collection along with the PDSC file is shipped in ZIP-format as a Software Pack. The PDSC file is designed
for software development environments and describes the user and device relevant context for the files supplied within such
a Software Pack. A Software Pack can be used for multiple purposes (see below).

After installing a \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack", all included software components are available to the development
tools. \ref cp_Components "Software components" are a collection of source modules, header and configuration files as well as
libraries. Packs containing software components can also include \ref cp_Examples and \ref cp_CodeTemplates.

The \subpage pack_revisionHistory lists the main changes between versions.

\section SWPackVariants Software Pack Use Cases

\image html SPVariants_small.png  "Software Pack Use Cases"

The figure above shows the following use cases for Software Packs:
  - <b>Device Family Pack (DFP):</b> contains CMSIS system/startup files, drivers, and flash algorithms for a microcontroller
    device family.
  - <b>CMSIS Software Pack:</b> contains the generic CMSIS components (CORE, DSP Library, and RTOS implementation) supplied by Arm.
  - <b>Middleware Pack:</b> contains software components belonging to a middleware (such as source code or libraries).
  - <b>Board Support Pack (BSP):</b> contains documentation, schematics, and drivers for a certain development board.
  - <b>In-house Software Packs:</b> usually contain software components that can be distributed within a
    company or engineering group.
  
\note A Software Pack can address multiple use cases at the same time!

The following sections give you more details on the basics:

 - \ref cp_Packs explains the steps required for creating a Software Pack in general.
 - \ref cp_SWComponents gives detailed information on the contents of the PDSC file.
 - \ref createPack_DFP describes additional requirements of Device Family Packs (DFPs).
 - \ref createPackBoard covers the creation of Board Support Packs (BSPs).
 - \ref pack_Example explains the Software Pack example that is part of the CMSIS Pack in more detail.
 - \ref createPackPublish shows the options for publishing a Pack.
 - \ref createPackUtil caters to programs that are useful during the creation of a Pack.
 - \ref packFormat describes all XML elements that can be used in a PDSC file.
 - \ref configWizard can be used to create GUI-like elements in development tools for configuration files.
 - \ref flashAlgorithm are used to erase or download applications to Flash devices.
 - \ref coresight_setup allow to create tool-agnostic debug and trace configurations
 - \ref cpdsc_pg is a environment/tool independent definition of a software project. This helps to create only one set of
   example projects that can be used by many different tool vendors.
