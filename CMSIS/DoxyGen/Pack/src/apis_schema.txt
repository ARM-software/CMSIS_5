Application Programming Interfaces (apis) are C/C++ interface specifications that allow software to be divided into largely independent modules. 
Such modules can then be developed, tested, and maintained independently, and reused by different projects. One example is the use of device drivers.
If device drivers are developed for different devices implementing the same API, the application software itself can be written independent from the
device it is build for.

The <b>apis</b> allow to distribute the Application Programming Interface Specifications decoupled from actual implementation. One example is the CMSIS-RTOS API,
which is specified as part of CMSIS, however, the actual RTOS implementation is provided by different vendors.

Unlike a software component, an API is not selectable. An API consists of a name, a brief description as well as one or more header files, and a document containing
a detailed specification of the API.

\section element_apis /package/apis

This element is a grouping element for all application programming interfaces included in the \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack".
The element itself is optional. Only one such section can exist in a package.

\b Example:
\code
<package>
  <apis>
    ...
  </apis>
</package>  
\endcode

\section element_api /package/apis/api

Application Programming Interfaces (apis) are C/C++ interface specifications that allow components to interwork 
by either implementing or using a set of functions, data types, and definitions. This element is mandatory and can exist multiple times.

\b Example:
\code
<apis>
  <api Cclass="Device" Cgroup="Driver UART" exclusive="0">
    <description>UART Driver API for the Cortex-M processor based devices</description>
    <files>
      <file category="doc" name="Driver/Doc/UART/html/index.html"/>
      <file category="header" name="Driver/Include/Driver_UART.h"/>
    </files>
  </api>
  <api Cclass="Device" Cgroup="Driver SPI" exclusive="0">
    <description>SPI Driver API for the Cortex-M processor based devices</description>
    <files>
      <file category="doc" name="Driver/Doc/SPI/html/index.html"/>
      <file category="header" name="Driver/Include/Driver_SPI.h"/>
    </files>
  </api>
  ...
</apis>
\endcode
