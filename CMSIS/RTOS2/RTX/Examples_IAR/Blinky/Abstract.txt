The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for a simulated Cortex-M3 device

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  50 MHz
   - Core    =  25 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages
The simulation does not provide LEDs, so the state changes
are output on the Debug printf window:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The BLINKY example program is available for one target:

  Simulation:          configured for a simulated on-chip Flash

The example is compatible with other Cortex-M class devices.
Simply open the project settings, navigate to Device tab and
select another Cortex-M class device.
