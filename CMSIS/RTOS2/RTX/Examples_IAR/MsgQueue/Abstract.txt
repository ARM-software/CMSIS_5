The MsgQueue project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for a simulated Cortex-M3 device

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - Core    =  12 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example shows how to use a 
message queue to send data from one thread to another.
The message receiver thread prints the message contents
to the debug output window.

The MsgQueue example program is available for one target:

  Simulation:          configured for a simulated on-chip Flash
