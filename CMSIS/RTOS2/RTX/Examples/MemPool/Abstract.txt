The MemPool project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for a simulated Cortex-M3 device

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - Core    =  12 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example shows how to use a 
memory pool for dynamic object allocation.

The MemPool example program is available for one target:

  Simulation:          configured for a simulated on-chip Flash
