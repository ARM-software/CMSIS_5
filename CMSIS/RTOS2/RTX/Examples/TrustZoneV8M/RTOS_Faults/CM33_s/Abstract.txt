This ARM Cortex-M33 Security Test example project shows how the ARMv8-M
architecture reacts to potential security attacks. It uses CMSIS-Core and
CMSIS-RTOS2 (Keil RTX5).

To execute a test case, enter in the uVision Debugger command window
>TestCase=<n>
where <n> is a test case number (0..4).

After a test case has been executed, the security attack gets recorded in
the IncidentLog and the application is reset. The struct IncidentLogCopy
can be viewed in a watch window and shows the past four recorded incidents.
