This ARM Cortex-M33 secure/non-secure example project that
shows the setup for TrustZone for ARMv8-M applications.
The application uses CMSIS and can be executed on a Fixed
Virtual Platform (FVP) simulation model.

The application demonstrates function calls between secure
and non-secure state.

Secure application:
 - Setup code and start non-secure application.

Non-secure application:
 - Calls a secure function from non-secure state.
 - Calls a secure function that call back to a non-secure function.
