  \brief       Resolve an address relative to the storage controller into a memory address.
  \param[in]   addr The address for which we want a resolution to the processor's physical address space. It is an offset from the
               start of the storage map maintained by the owning storage
               controller.

/**
  \fn          int32_t ARM_Storage_GetNextBlock(const ARM_STORAGE_BLOCK* prev_block, ARM_STORAGE_BLOCK *next_block);
  \brief       Advance to the successor of the current block (iterator).
  \param[in]   prev_block An existing block (iterator) within the same storage
               controller. The memory buffer holding this block is owned
               by the caller. This pointer may be NULL; if so, the
               invocation fills in the first block into the out parameter:
               'next_block'.
  \param[out]  next_block A caller-owned buffer large enough to be filled in with
               the following ARM_STORAGE_BLOCK. It is legal to provide the
               same buffer using 'next_block' as was passed in with 'prev_block'. It
               is also legal to pass a NULL into this parameter if the
               caller isn't interested in populating a buffer with the next
               block, i.e. if the caller only wishes to establish the
               presence of a next block.
  \return      ARM_DRIVER_OK if a valid next block is found (or first block, if
               prev_block is passed as NULL); upon successful operation, the contents
               of the next (or first) block are filled into the buffer pointed to by
               the parameter 'next_block' and ARM_STORAGE_VALID_BLOCK(next_block) is
               guaranteed to be true. Upon reaching the end of the sequence of blocks
               (iterators), or in case the driver is unable to fetch information about
               the next (or first) block, an error (negative) value is returned and an
               invalid StorageBlock is populated into the supplied buffer. If
               prev_block is NULL, the first block is returned.

/**
  \fn          int32_t ARM_Storage_GetBlock(uint64_t addr, ARM_STORAGE_BLOCK *block);
  \brief       Find the storage block (iterator) encompassing a given storage address.
  \param[in]   addr Storage address in bytes.
  \param[out]  block A caller-owned buffer large enough to be filled in with the
               ARM_STORAGE_BLOCK encapsulating the given address. This value
               can also be passed in as NULL if the caller isn't interested
               in populating a buffer with the block, if the caller only
               wishes to establish the presence of a containing storage
               block.
  \return      ARM_DRIVER_OK if a containing storage-block is found. In this case,
               if block is non-NULL, the buffer pointed to by it is populated with
               the contents of the storage block, i.e. if block is valid and a block is
               found, ARM_STORAGE_VALID_BLOCK(block) would return true following this
               call. If there is no storage block containing the given offset, or in
               case the driver is unable to resolve an address to a storage-block, an
               error (negative) value is returned and an invalid StorageBlock is
               populated into the supplied buffer.
