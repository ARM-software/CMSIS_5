   * @par        Algorithm
   *               The bubble sort algorithm is a simple comparison algorithm that
   *               reads the elements of a vector from the beginning to the end,
   *               compares the adjacent ones and swaps them if they are in the 
   *               wrong order. The procedure is repeated until there is nothing 
   *               left to swap. Bubble sort is fast for input vectors that are
   *               nearly sorted.
   *
   * @par          It's an in-place algorithm. In order to obtain an out-of-place
   *               function, a memcpy of the source vector is performed
