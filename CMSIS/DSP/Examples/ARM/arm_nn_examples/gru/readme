This is an example of how to buid a GRU from the kernels.

NOTE: We only tested the kernels we have. We do not have GRU network, so the function correctness of the GRU cell is not tested.

File list:
CMSIS_5 : symbolic link to CMSIS_5
main.cpp : main file
Makefile : compiling script
mbed : directory containing board specific libs
sp_monitor.py: a python script to open the serial port
para_gen.py: a python script to generate some test input and does weight re-ordering
weights.h : the network weights generated by para_gen.py
