/**
 * This is the set of operations constituting the Storage driver. Their
 * implementation is platform-specific, and needs to be supplied by the
 * porting effort.
 *
 * Some APIs within `ARM_DRIVER_STORAGE` will always operate synchronously:
 * GetVersion, GetCapabilities, GetStatus, GetInfo, ResolveAddress,
 * GetNextBlock, and GetBlock. This means that control returns to the caller
 * with a relevant status code only after the completion of the operation (or
 * the discovery of a failure condition).
 *
 * The remainder of the APIs: Initialize, Uninitialize, PowerControl, ReadData,
 * ProgramData, Erase, EraseAll, can function asynchronously if the underlying
 * controller supports it--i.e. if ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES::asynchronous_ops is
 * set. In the case of asynchronous operation, the invocation returns early
 * (with ARM_DRIVER_OK) and results in a completion callback later. If
 * ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES::asynchronous_ops is not set, then all such APIs
 * execute synchronously, and control returns to the caller with a status code
 * only after the completion of the operation (or the discovery of a failure
 * condition).
 *
 * If ARM_STORAGE_CAPABILITIES::asynchronous_ops is set, a storage driver may
 * still choose to execute asynchronous operations in a synchronous manner. If
 * so, the driver returns a positive value to indicate successful synchronous
 * completion (or an error code in case of failure) and no further invocation of
 * completion callback should be expected. The expected return value for
 * synchronous completion of such asynchronous operations varies depending on
 * the operation. For operations involving data access, it often equals the
 * amount of data transferred or affected. For non data-transfer operations,
 * such as EraseAll or Initialize, it is usually 1.
 *
 * Here's a code snippet to suggest how asynchronous APIs might be used by
 * callers to handle both synchronous and asynchronous execution by the
 * underlying storage driver:
 * \code
 *     ASSERT(ARM_DRIVER_OK == 0); // this is a precondition; it doesn't need to be put in code
 *     int32_t returnValue = drv->asynchronousAPI(...);
 *     if (returnValue < ARM_DRIVER_OK) {
 *         // handle error.
 *     } else if (returnValue == ARM_DRIVER_OK) {
 *         ASSERT(drv->GetCapabilities().asynchronous_ops == 1);
 *         // handle early return from asynchronous execution; remainder of the work is done in the callback handler.
 *     } else {
 *         ASSERT(returnValue == EXPECTED_RETURN_VALUE_FOR_SYNCHRONOUS_COMPLETION);
 *         // handle synchronous completion.

  /**
   * \brief Initialize the Storage Interface.
   *
   * The function Initialize is called when the middleware component starts
   * operation. In addition to bringing the controller to a ready state,
   * Initialize() receives a callback handler to be invoked upon completion of
   * asynchronous operations.
   *
   * Initialize() needs to be called explicitly before
   * powering the peripheral using PowerControl(), and before initiating other
   * accesses to the storage controller.
   *
   * The function performs the following operations:
   *   - Initializes the resources needed for the Storage interface.
   *   - Registers the \ref ARM_Storage_Callback_t callback function.
   *
   * To start working with a peripheral the functions Initialize and PowerControl need to be called in this order:
   *     drv->Initialize (...); // Allocate I/O pins
   *     drv->PowerControl (ARM_POWER_FULL);        // Power up peripheral, setup IRQ/DMA
   *
   * - Initialize() typically allocates the I/O resources (pins) for the
   *   peripheral. The function can be called multiple times; if the I/O resources
   *   are already initialized it performs no operation and just returns with
   *   ARM_DRIVER_OK.
   *
   * - PowerControl (ARM_POWER_FULL) sets the peripheral registers including
   *   interrupt (NVIC) and optionally DMA. The function can be called multiple
   *   times; if the registers are already set it performs no operation and just
   *   returns with ARM_DRIVER_OK.
   *
   * To stop working with a peripheral the functions PowerControl and Uninitialize need to be called in this order:
   *     drv->PowerControl (ARM_POWER_OFF);     // Terminate any pending transfers, reset IRQ/DMA, power off peripheral
   *     drv->Uninitialize (...);               // Release I/O pins
   *
   * The functions PowerControl and Uninitialize always execute and can be used
   * to put the peripheral into a Safe State, for example after any data
   * transmission errors. To restart the peripheral in an error condition,
   * you should first execute the Stop Sequence and then the Start Sequence.
   *
   * @param [in] callback
   *               Caller-defined callback to be invoked upon command completion
   *               for asynchronous APIs (including the completion of
   *               initialization). Use a NULL pointer when no callback
   *               signals are required.
   *

   *     drv->Initialize (...);                 // Allocate I/O pins
   *     drv->PowerControl (ARM_POWER_FULL);    // Power up peripheral, setup IRQ/DMA
   *
   * - Initialize() typically allocates the I/O resources (pins) for the
   *   peripheral. The function can be called multiple times; if the I/O resources
   *   are already initialized it performs no operation and just returns with
   *   ARM_DRIVER_OK.
   *
   * - PowerControl (ARM_POWER_FULL) sets the peripheral registers including
   *   interrupt (NVIC) and optionally DMA. The function can be called multiple
   *   times; if the registers are already set it performs no operation and just
   *   returns with ARM_DRIVER_OK.

   *     drv->Uninitialize (...);               // Release I/O pins
   *
   * The functions PowerControl and Uninitialize always execute and can be used

   * transmission errors. To restart the peripheral in an error condition,
   * you should first execute the Stop Sequence and then the Start Sequence.

   *                                 (NVIC) and optionally DMA. Can be called multiple times. If the peripheral
   *                                 is already in this mode, then the function performs no operation and returns
   *                                 with ARM_DRIVER_OK.
