Creating a new Algorithm
------------------------

Flash programming algorithms are defined with functions to erase and program
the Flash device. Special compiler and linker settings are required. Follow
these steps to create and configure a new Flash programming algorithm:
- From the toolbar, use the drop-down Select Target to define the processor
  architecture. Cortex-M fits for all Arm Cortex-M0/M0+/M3/M4/M7 devices.
  The configuration assumes a little-endian microcontroller. In case of a
  big-endian microcontroller, select the correct processor core with
  Project - Options for Target - Device.
- Open the dialog Project - Options for Target - Output and change the content
  of the field Name of Executable to represent the device, for example
  MyDevice.
- Adapt the programming algorithms in the file FlashPrg.c
- Adapt the device parameters in the file FlashDev.c
- Use Project - Build Target to generate the new Flash programming algorithm.
  The output file (for example MyDevice.FLM) has to be added to the DFP.

Note
----
- Creating a Flash programming algorithm with MDK-Lite is not supported.
- Flash programming algorithms use Read-Only Position Independent and
  Read-Write Position Independent program code. These options are set in the
  dialogs Project - Options for Target - C/C++ and
  Project - Options for Target - Asm.
- The dialog Project - Options for Target - Linker defines the linker scatter
  file Target.lin. The error L6305 is disabled with -diag_suppress L6305.
