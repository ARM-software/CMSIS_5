Creating a new Algorithm
------------------------

Flash programming algorithms are defined with functions to erase and program
the Flash device. Special compiler and linker settings are required. Follow
these steps to create and configure a new Flash programming algorithm:
- Select an apropriate ARMCM# (ARMCM0 .. ARMCM7).
- Choose a meaningful name for your project and the algorithm.
- Adapt the programming algorithms in the file FlashPrg.c
- Adapt the device parameters in the file FlashDev.c
- Use CMSIS-Build to build the project.
- Rename the AXF | ELF file to FLM.

Note
----
- Flash programming algorithms use Read-Only Position Independent and
  Read-Write Position Independent program code. The used compiler must
  support these options.
