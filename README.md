# CMSIS Version 5

The branch *master* of this GitHub repository contains the CMSIS Version 5.1.0  The [documentation](http://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/General/html/index.html) is available under http://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/General/html/index.html

Use [Issues](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5#issues-and-labels) to provide feedback and report problems for CMSIS Version 5. 

**Note:** The branch *develop* of this GitHub repository reflects our current state of development and is constantly updated. It gives our users and partners contiguous access to the CMSIS development. It allows you to review the work and provide feedback or create pull requests for contributions.

A [pre-built documentation](http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS_Dev/index.html) is updated from time to time, but may be also generated using the instructions under [Generate CMSIS Pack for Release](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5#generate-cmsis-pack-for-release).

## What's Hot
 - CMSIS-RTOS2: RTX 5 is now available for IAR, GCC, ARM Compiler 5, ARM Compiler 6
 - CMSIS-RTOS2: FreeRTOS adoption (release) is available https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-FreeRTOS
 - CMSIS-Core: compiler agnostic features extended to simplify transition on LLVM based front-end
 - CMSIS-Core-A: preview of the CMSIS-Core for Cortex-A
 - Coming soon: CMSIS-RTOS2 for Cortex-A

## Implemented Enhancements
 - Support for ARMv8-M Architecture (Mainline and Baseline) as well as devices Cortex-M23 and Cortex-M33

 - CMSIS-RTOS Version 2 API and RTX reference implementation with several enhancements:
     - Dynamic object creation, Flag events, C API, additional thread and timer functions

 - CMSIS-RTOS API Secure and Non-Secure support, multi-processor support

## Further Planned Enhancements
 - CMSIS-Core-A: Cortex-A processor support
 - CMSIS-RTOS: RTX5 for Cortex-A
 - CMSIS-DAP: extended trace support
 - CMSIS-Zone: management of complex system
     - Improvements for Cortex-A / M hybrid devices (focus on Cortex-M interaction)
 - CMSIS-Pack 
     - Additions for generic example and project templates
     - Adoption of IAR Flash Loader technology

## Generate CMSIS Pack for Release

This GitHub development repository contains already pre-built libraries of various software components (DSP, RTOS, RTOS2).
These libraries are validated for release.

To build a complete CMSIS pack for installation the following additional tools are required:
 - **doxygen.exe**    Version: 1.8.6 (Documentation Generator)
 - **mscgen.exe**     Version: 0.20  (Message Sequence Chart Converter)
 - **7z.exe (7-Zip)** Version: 16.02 (File Archiver)
  
Using these tools, you can generate on a Windows PC:
 - **CMSIS Software Pack** using the batch file **gen_pack.bat** (located in ./CMSIS/Utilities). This batch file also generates the documentation.
  
 - **CMSIS Documentation** using the batch file **genDoc.bat** (located in ./CMSIS/Doxygen). 

The file ./CMSIS/DoxyGen/How2Doc.txt describes the rules for creating API documentation.
